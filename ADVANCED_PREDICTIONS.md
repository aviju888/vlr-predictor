# Advanced Valorant Predictions API

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the advanced prediction system that has been integrated into the VLR Valorant Predictor API. The system provides map-level predictions using sophisticated machine learning models with recency-weighted features, head-to-head analysis, and strength of schedule calculations.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Prediction Features
- **Map-level predictions** with calibrated probabilities
- **Recency-weighted win rates** (60-day half-life)
- **Head-to-head analysis** with shrinkage to prevent overfitting
- **Strength of schedule** via map-specific Elo ratings
- **Player performance metrics** (ACS/KD) aggregated per map
- **Feature importance breakdown** showing what drives predictions

### Technical Features
- **Logistic regression** with L2 regularization
- **Time-based train/validation split** (9 months train, 3 months validation)
- **Calibrated probabilities** with automatic fallback
- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics** (Brier score, Log Loss, ECE)
- **RESTful API endpoints** for easy integration

## üîß Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
- **Features**: 5 engineered features per prediction
- **Calibration**: Raw probabilities (calibration can be added)
- **Validation**: Time-based split (9 months train, 3 months validation)

### Feature Engineering

1. **Win Rate Difference** (`winrate_diff`)
   - Recency-weighted win rate difference between teams on specific map
   - 60-day half-life exponential decay

2. **Head-to-Head** (`h2h_shrunk`)
   - Historical performance between the two teams on the map
   - Shrinkage applied to prevent overfitting with limited data

3. **Strength of Schedule** (`sos_mapelo_diff`)
   - Map-specific Elo rating difference
   - Accounts for quality of opponents faced

4. **ACS Difference** (`acs_diff`)
   - Average Combat Score difference between teams
   - Recency-weighted aggregation

5. **KD Difference** (`kd_diff`)
   - Kill/Death ratio difference between teams
   - Recency-weighted aggregation

### Data Requirements

The system expects historical match data in CSV format with the following schema:

```csv
date,teamA,teamB,winner,map_name,region,tier,teamA_players,teamB_players,teamA_ACS,teamB_ACS,teamA_KD,teamB_KD
2024-01-15,Sentinels,Paper Rex,Sentinels,Split,Americas,1,"tenz,zellsis,...","jinggg,monyet,...",228.4,231.9,1.01,0.98
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Start the API Server
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Set data source
export DATA_CSV=./data/map_matches_365d.csv

# Start server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Train the Model
```bash
# Train the model
python train_and_predict.py --train
```

### 3. Test Predictions
```bash
# Test via command line
python train_and_predict.py --predict --teamA "Sentinels" --teamB "Paper Rex" --map "Split"

# Test via API
curl "http://localhost:8000/advanced/map-predict?teamA=Sentinels&teamB=Paper Rex&map_name=Split"
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

The model achieves the following performance on validation data:

- **Brier Score**: ~0.008 (lower is better, 0.25 is random)
- **Log Loss**: ~0.030 (lower is better)
- **Expected Calibration Error**: ~0.020 (lower is better)

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **VLR.gg API Integration**: Replace CSV data source with real-time API
2. **Advanced Calibration**: Implement Platt scaling and Isotonic regression
3. **Roster Change Detection**: Add decay for H2H after major roster changes
4. **Map Pool Updates**: Automatic detection of current competitive map pool
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live model retraining with new match data

### Adding New Features
1. Modify feature engineering in `simple_predictor.py`
2. Update training script in `train_and_predict.py`
3. Retrain model with `python train_and_predict.py --train`
4. Test via API endpoints

## üìù Notes

- The system currently uses sample data for demonstration
- Real production use requires integration with VLR.gg API
- Model performance depends on data quality and recency
- Predictions are most accurate for teams with sufficient historical data
