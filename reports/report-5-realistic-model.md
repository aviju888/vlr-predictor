# Report 5: Realistic Model Training

## Summary
Trained a model using real VLR.gg data with ONLY historical features.

## Key Changes
1. **Real Data**: Used actual VLR.gg data instead of synthetic
2. **Historical Features Only**: No outcome-based features (ACS, K/D)
3. **Temporal Split**: Proper train/test split by date
4. **No Data Leakage**: Features calculated only from past matches

## Features Used
1. Overall winrate difference (historical)
2. Map-specific winrate difference (historical)
3. Head-to-head record (historical)
4. Recent form - last 3 matches (historical)
5. Experience difference (total matches)
6. Rest advantage (days since last match)

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 0.643 (64.3%)
- **Training Period**: 2025-09-03 00:00:00 to 2025-09-07 00:00:00
- **Testing Period**: 2025-09-07 00:00:00 to 2025-09-08 00:00:00
- **Training Matches**: 110
- **Testing Matches**: 28

## Validation
- ✅ Real VLR.gg data (not synthetic)
- ✅ No outcome-based features
- ✅ Only historical win/loss data
- ✅ Proper temporal constraints
- ✅ Model saved as `realistic_model.joblib`

## Next Steps
1. Integrate realistic model into API
2. Test on live predictions
3. Monitor performance on new matches
