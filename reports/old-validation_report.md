```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Data Quality
- **Tier 1 Focus**: Model now trained on highest-level competitive matches
- **Recent Data**: Includes 2025 VCT Masters tournaments
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced metrics for team performance analysis

### 2. Calibrated Probabilities
- **Isotonic Calibration**: Ensures probabilities are well-calibrated
- **Uncertainty Indicators**: Low/Med/High confidence levels
- **Data Sufficiency**: Blends with Elo when data is sparse

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Recency Weighting**: Recent performance weighted more heavily
- **Head-to-Head**: Shrunk H2H records prevent overfitting
- **Map-Specific**: Elo ratings per map for better accuracy
- **Player Stats**: ACS and K/D differences for team strength

## Model Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (Low Uncertainty)
- Teams with 15+ recent matches on specific map
- Strong historical data available
- Clear performance trends

### Medium Confidence (Med Uncertainty)
- Teams with 5-14 recent matches
- Some data blending with Elo model
- Reasonable prediction confidence

### Low Confidence (High Uncertainty)
- Teams with <5 recent matches
- Heavy blending with Elo model
- Predictions should be interpreted cautiously

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Monitor Performance**: Track prediction accuracy on live matches
2. **Update Regularly**: Retrain with new tournament data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Add more advanced metrics as available
4. **Validation**: Cross-validate on held-out tournament data

### For Demo Purposes
1. **Use Tier 1 Teams**: Best predictions for established teams
2. **Recent Matches**: Focus on teams with recent competitive activity
3. **Map Selection**: Use current map pool for most accurate results
4. **Series Predictions**: BO3 simulations provide comprehensive analysis

## Conclusion
