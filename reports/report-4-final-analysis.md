# Report 4: Final Data Leakage Analysis

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FINDING: Data is 100% Synthetic**

### **The Problem**
The "VLR.gg data" in `data/map_matches_365d.csv` is **completely synthetic** and **perfectly predictable**:

1. **Only 4 teams**: Sentinels, NRG, LOUD, Paper Rex
2. **Perfect alternating pattern**: Team A wins, then Team B, then Team A, etc.
3. **No randomness**: Every match follows the exact same pattern
4. **Predictable outcomes**: A simple algorithm can predict with 100% accuracy

### **Why 100% Accuracy is Impossible in Real Data**
- **Real esports**: 65-70% accuracy is realistic
- **Sports betting**: 55-60% accuracy is market-efficient
- **Perfect prediction**: 100% accuracy means the data is **artificial**

### **Evidence of Synthetic Data**
```
Match 1:  Sentinels vs Paper Rex -> Sentinels
Match 2:  LOUD vs NRG -> NRG  
Match 3:  Paper Rex vs LOUD -> LOUD
Match 4:  NRG vs Sentinels -> Sentinels
... (perfect alternating pattern continues)
```

### **What This Means**
1. **No Real Validation**: We can't validate on synthetic data
2. **False Confidence**: 100% accuracy is meaningless
3. **Data Collection Failed**: We need actual VCT match results

## 🔧 **The Real Fix**

### **Step 1: Collect Real VCT Data**
- Use actual VCT Masters 2024/2025 results
- Include real team performance metrics
- Ensure data has realistic uncertainty

### **Step 2: Proper Feature Engineering**
- Historical winrates (last 10 matches)
- Map-specific performance
- Head-to-head records
- Recent form trends
- **NO outcome-based features** (ACS, K/D from the match being predicted)

### **Step 3: Realistic Validation**
- Temporal splits (train on past, test on future)
- Cross-validation with proper constraints
- Target accuracy: **65-70%** (not 100%)

### **Step 4: Model Calibration**
- Use Platt scaling or Isotonic regression
- Ensure probabilities are well-calibrated
- Add uncertainty estimates

## 📊 **Current Status**

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Data** | ❌ Synthetic | Need real VCT data |
| **Features** | ✅ Historical | No outcome leakage |
| **Validation** | ❌ Perfect | Data is predictable |
| **Model** | ✅ Trained | But on fake data |

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Collect Real Data**: Get actual VCT Masters results
2. **Validate Properly**: Use temporal splits with real data
3. **Target Realistic Accuracy**: Aim for 65-70%, not 100%
4. **Deploy with Confidence**: Know the model works on real matches

## 💡 **Key Insight**

The 100% accuracy was a **red flag**, not a success. It revealed that our data was synthetic and predictable. A properly validated model on real esports data should achieve **65-70% accuracy** - anything higher suggests data leakage or synthetic data.

---

**Bottom Line**: We need real VCT data to build a meaningful prediction model. The current synthetic data is useless for validation.
